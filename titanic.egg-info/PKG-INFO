        In the first part of the tutorial, we set up the project, so that we
        start with an effective working environment.
        
           Note to Windows users: The commands in tutorial work on the Unix Bash
           command line. In order to get them to work on Windows, you can use
           `Cygwin <https://www.cygwin.com/>`__ or related applications.
        
        Virtual Environment
        -------------------
        
        Python has a useful feature, called `virtual
        environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`__, which
        allows to hold a collection of packages in an isolated Python
        environment. Since we want to keep the Python packages associated to
        this project separate from those associated to other projects, we create
        a virtual environment. After making sure that Python 3 is installed in
        the system, we use
        ```virtualenvwrapper`` <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__
        to initialise a virtual environment called ``titanic_datascience``.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           mkvirtualenv --python=python3 titanic_datascience
        
        The environment should be activated by default after creation. However,
        if it is not active, you can activate it with the command
        ``workon titanic_datascience``. We can use the command ``which python``
        to get the path of the Python executable to verify that we are in the
        correct environment.
        
        Project Structure
        -----------------
        
        We start by creating a `minimal structure for a Python
        package <http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html>`__,
        which will be at the core of automation and productionisation. Go into
        the folder where you would like to store the project, which you may call
        ``titanic_datascience`` for coherency with the name of the virtual
        environment, and create the following structure of folders 📁 and files
        📄.
        
        ::
        
           📁 titanic/
               📄 __init__.py
           📄 README.md
           📄 setup.py
        
        ..
        
           If you are unfamiliar with the unix terminal, use ``pwd`` to check
           which folder you are currently into, ``ls`` to list folders and files
           in the current folder, ``cd path-to-folder`` to move folder,
           ``mkdir folder-name`` to create a new folder and ``touch file-name``
           to create a new file.
        
        Here is a description of the structure above:
        
        -  The folder called ```titanic/`` <titanic>`__ is dedicated to the
           Python package for production.
        
        -  ```titanic/__init__.py`` <titanic/__init__.py>`__ is an empty file to
           `initialise <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages>`__
           the titanic package.
        
              Note that ``__init__.py`` files do not have to be empty and can be
              used, for example, to initialise code for the package.
        
        -  `➠ ``setup.py`` <setup.py>`__ is the `setup
           script <https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html>`__ that
           is run when installing the module. You may want to change the
           ``author`` and ``author_email`` fields in ```setup.py`` <setup.py>`__
           to match your details.
        
        -  The Markdown file ```README.md`` <README.md>`__ should contain a
           description of the package. Moreover, the ``readme()`` function in
           ```setup.py`` <setup.py>`__ adds the content of
           ```README.md`` <README.md>`__ to the ``long_description`` parameter
           of the package in ``setup()``, and requires the package
           ```pypandoc`` <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc>`__ to be
           installed.
        
           .. code:: shell
        
              pip install pypandoc==1.4
        
           ..
        
              Note that when installing packages with ``pip``, we specify the
              package version in order to make sure that we can run the code
              without issues. When you will create your own setup for different
              projects, it is better to use updated packages by omitting the
              version number.
        
              .. code:: shell
        
                 pip install pypandoc
        
           Since files called ```README.md`` <README.md>`__ are automatically
           displayed by GitHub as webpage descriptions,
           ```README.md`` <README.md>`__ has been used for the content that you
           are reading in this moment. In your case, instead, you may start this
           file with,
        
           .. code:: markdown
        
              # Analysis of the Titanic dataset
        
              This projects aims at analysing Kaggle's Titanic dataset and build a predictive model for the Titanic data science challenge.
        
           and add information as the project progresses.
        
        Having created the above files, we can install the local
        ```titanic/`` <titanic>`__ package in `development
        mode <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs>`__,
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           pip install -e .
        
        The option ``-e``, standing for ``--editable``, installs the package in
        `development
        mode <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs>`__,
        that is, `using a
        symlink <http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html#creating-the-scaffolding>`__
        to the local ```titanic/`` <titanic>`__ folder so that we can develop
        the package while it is installed. We use ``.`` to indicate the folder
        where ```setup.py`` <setup.py>`__ is.
        
        In addition to the Python package structure just created for automation
        and productionisation, we need a folder that will contain exploratory
        analyses and a folder to store data to be used only for exploration. For
        these, we create the folders ```exploration/`` <exploration>`__ and
        ```exploration/data/`` <exploration/data>`__, which should be left
        outside of the ```titanic/`` <titanic>`__ package, as the package should
        only contain elements aimed at production. For the data, download
        ``train.csv`` from the `➠ Titanic data science competition
        page <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>`__, rename it to
        ``titanic.csv`` and store it in
        ```exploration/data/`` <exploration/data>`__.
        
           Note that in this case the data, being small, is store directly in
           our project folder. If the data is big or confidential, it should be
           stored in different places, for example in a secure cloud location.
        
        ..
        
           It is good to create ``README.md`` files in the
           ```exploration/`` <exploration>`__ and
           ```exploration/data/`` <exploration/data>`__ folders when something
           about the data and exploration should be told, like good practices
           and conventions. For example, it may be useful to store data in zip
           archives to save some space, and this should be written in the
           ``README.md`` in the data folder so that other people will be
           consistent with the choice.
        
        Putting all together, we get the following project structure.
        
        ::
        
           📁 exploration/
               📁 data/
                   📄 titanic.csv
           📁 titanic/
               📄 __init__.py
           📄 README.md
           📄 setup.py
        
        ..
        
           Although for data science this is a general base structure, some
           projects may require different ones. To understand what is a suitable
           base structure for a project, it may be helpful to think about the
           data as the start point and the project goal as the end point, and
           see how exploration can bridge the gap. In our case, the start point
           is the Titanic data and the end point is predicting the passenger
           survival.
        
           Asking questions about how to bridge the start and end points may
           help clarify what is needed for the project. This does not mean
           trying to predict the details of the projects ahead of time, as this
           would lead to a strict template that prevents flexibility. Instead,
           this exercise should help understand what is necessary.
        
        The project structure that we have created can be explored at the `top
        of this page <#>`__.
        
        Now that the project has been set up, we proceed to the next part of the
        tutorial where we will see how multiple people can collaborate on the
        project.
